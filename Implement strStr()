Implement strStr().

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

 

class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        if(needle.isEmpty())
            return 0;
       int i=0, n = haystack.length(), m = needle.length(); 
        for(i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(i+m <= n){
              String check = haystack.substring(i,i+m);
                if(check.equals(needle))
                return i;
            }
            
        }
        return -1;
      
    }
}
